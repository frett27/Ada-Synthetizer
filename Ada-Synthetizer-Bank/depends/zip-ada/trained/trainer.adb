--  Trainer
-------------------
--  This is a demo showing the creation of the compressed trainer
--  data for Trained_Compression, to be used on the decoding side.
--
--  This is almost the same as using the trained encoder with a zero
--  trainer file, but the compressed trainer stub is encoded without
--  end-of-stream marker, which makes more predictable the length
--  of the compressed stream which is common between trainer only
--  and trainer+data.
--
--  See the trtest_single.cmd script for an example
