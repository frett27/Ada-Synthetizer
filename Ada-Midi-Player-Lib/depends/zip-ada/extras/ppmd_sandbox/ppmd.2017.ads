--  DRAFT - NOT YET FUNCTIONAL!
--

--  PPMd library
----------------
--  Library for encoding and decoding data streams in the PPMd compression
--  format invented by Dmitry Subbotin and Dmitry Shkarin (PPMd var.H (2001)).
--  The Ada code is based on the recoding done by Igor Pavlov.
--  Some de-obfuscation hints and de-pointerization techniques are
--  from PpmdSharp by Michael Bone.
--
--  PPM means: Prediction by Partial Matching.
--
--  Pure Ada 95+ code, 100% portable: OS-, CPU- and compiler- independent.
