# Interfacing with C and Java

*Patrice Freydiere - Octobre 2019*



### Needs

C and Java interfaÃ§ing are for sequencer implementation, permitting to :

- play midi with extensions
- using soundbank, swich instruments



## Primitives

Real time playin, for feedback in the sequencer

ahead of time playing, with sequencer time feedback :

- this lead to event definitions, and also realtime modifiers
  - reference to voices -> voice feedback modification for pitch, chorus ... etc



Use Handles associated to objects, this permit to free memory and allocate on needs
