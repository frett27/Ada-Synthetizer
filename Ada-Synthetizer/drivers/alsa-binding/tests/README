A few things to remember when creating a new test:

* Use Ada.Command_Line to set the exit status of the test.
* Remember that all executable files in the test directory _will_ be executed.
* Use the "test_name.argument" file to add command line arguments to the test.
  One argument per line.
* Use the "test_name.allowed_time_in_seconds" file to set an allowed running
  time different from the 10 seconds default value.

When running the tests:

* "build.status" and "run.status" contains slightly more detailed output from
  the building and running of tests.
